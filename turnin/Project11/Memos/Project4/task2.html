<h1>Memo: Analysis of Functions and Data Representations</h1>

<h2>Rachel Ober and Brandon Schory</h2>

<p>
Stack requires take
<br /><br />
At the beginning of a player's turn he must choose either one card from the face down stack, or at least one card from the face up stack. The take method allows pulling one or more cards off of the stack that the player can then add to his hand. (Use Case: Player takes a turn)
</p>

<p>
Deck needs empty
<br /><br />
In each battle, each player receives 7 cards, and the rest are put in to the face up/face down stacks. One needs to be able to check that the deck is empty to be sure that all cards have been either dealt to player or put in the stack. (Use Case: Administrator plays a game)
</p>

<p>
Hand has wildcards
<br /><br />
The wildcards method is part of the typical sorting habits a player would have. He would typically group all wildcards together, to facilitate determining how many and what kinds of wildcards they have to utilize to complete squadrons. This allows them to easily complete squadrons and thus score points. (Use Case: Player takes a turn)
</p>

<p>
Why is Squadron needed
<br /><br />
A squadron data representation facilitates users in organizing their cards to score points. The user scores points by placing a complete squadron from their hand on the table. The squadron data representation facilitates determining when squadrons are complete, their alliance (for attacking other squadrons), and their type (for scoring).
