<h1>Memo: How Open Cable Application Platform relates to CSU670</h1>

<h2>Rachel Ober and Kaitlyn Hanrahan</h2>

<p>
The Open Cable Application Platform (OCAP) is a standard operating 
system layer for electronics that connect to North American cable 
television.  Cable companies would like OCAP included in the Cablecard 
2.0 specification, requiring all third party devices to support OCAP.  
This relates to the model-view-pattern we are using in 670 that 
separates the GUI and logic code so that two different toolkits could be 
used to visualize the same Player code.  Different GUI code could be 
implemented on top of the logic; compared to different devices can 
connect to different televisions.  The test-fest projects are related to 
OCAP in a similar way.  While the groups are using different languages, 
we can still talk to each other by using XML, a standard protocol; just 
as OCAP is a standard layer allowing different televisions and devices 
to talk to each other. </p>
