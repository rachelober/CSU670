Project 6: Checking Players

Included in this release are the following files:

/README
    This is the current file, which describes the contents of 
    this project release.

/code
    Directory for all project code.

/code/card.rb
    Contains data representation of Cards.

/code/code.rb
    Short file that requires the different classes so they can
    be executed.

/code/deck.rb
    Contains data representation of Decks (built from index.xml).

/code/hand.rb
    Contains data representation of a Players Hand.

/code/index.xml
    Parsed index.xml file from aircraft directory.

/code/player.rb
    Contains data representation of a Player

/code/proxy_player.rb
    Contains data representation of ProxyPlayer (inherits from Player, IO)

/code/proxy_turn.rb
    Contains data representation of ProxyTurn (inherits from Turn, IO).

/code/rtparser.rb
    Copied from Tree Parser, with an added line to check the end of an XML message.

/code/squadron.rb
    Contains data representation of Squadrons.

/code/stack.rb
    Contains data representation of Stacks of Cards.

/code/tester_proxyplayer.rb
    Makes IO and instance calls to test ProxyPlayer

/code/tester_proxyturn.rb
    Makes IO and instance calls to test ProxyTurn

/code/turn.rb
    Contains data representation of a Player's Turn.

/code/xmlhelper.rb
    Contains methods that convert data structures to and from XML

/compile    
    This is a dummy file. When executing the bash script as 
    "bash compile" it will print a message to the screen alerting 
    the user that the "run" script will need to be executed. 
    Because our code is written in ruby, it is unnecessary to 
    compile it.

/run
    This is a file that runs the /code/code.rb file. Since the code 
    contains no methods that are inherently designed to run, 
    purely running code.rb will do nothing but prove there are 
    no syntax errors.

/run-tests
    This executes the /tests/tests.rb file. This runs a Ruby
    test unit test suite. It returns how many tests were executed,
    the count for failures and errors.

/testcases
    Directory for test files.  Changed from /tests at Project 6/7
