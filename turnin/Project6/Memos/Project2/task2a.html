<h1>Memo: Potential Transaction Errors When Purchasing Gas on a Refill Trip</h1>

<h2>Rachel Ober and Brandon Schory</h2>

<p>
1. Rejection of credit card
</p>

<p>
If the credit card is rejected at the pump, the pump should inform them to visit the cashier to determine another form of payment. The cashier will ask for another credit card, cash, or inform the patron that he must leave and come back with a valid form of payment.
</p>

<p>
2. The driver decides to drive away after getting his credit card authorized and before lifting the handle
</p>

<p>
Should the driver leave after swiping his credit card but before lifting the handle, the pump should wait a short period of time for the handle to be lifted, or reset the transaction and prompt for a method of payment.
</p>

<p>
3. The driver fills his tank and then forgets to press YES or NO for the usual &quot;do you want a receipt question&quot;
</p>

<p>
Should the driver not answer the &quot;would you like a receipt&quot; question by pressing either yes or no, the pump, after a short time, should default to “no”, close the transaction, and return to prompting for payment.
</p>

<p>
4. The driver tries to pump gas before offering a valid method of payment
</p>

<p>
Until a valid method of payment is offered, the pump should not let the patron select a type of gas. Should the patron lift the handle and put it in his car, the pump should not allow gas to flow until payment has been received and the type of gas has been selected.
</p>

<p>
5. The patron tries to get more gas than what they have paid for with cash
</p>

<p>
The pump, under all circumstances, should not pump more gas than was paid for in a cash transaction. Should the patron need to purchase more gas, they will need to begin a new cash transaction with the cashier.
