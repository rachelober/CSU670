<h1>Memo: Process Analysis of Purchasing Gas at a Self or Full Service Gas Station</h1>

<h2>Rachel Ober and Brandon Schory</h2>

<p>
Below is a description of the process of purchasing gas at a standard self-service gas station. It is important to note that for full service gas stations, the process is predominantly the same, with the only difference being that the customer expresses his wishes to an attendant, who then handles the process from accepting payment for the gas through replacing the gas tank cover and cap. All steps are still adhered to in the same order, but with the previous changes of subject noted. As such, both station types are described in the following process:
</p>

<p>
Gas station patrons looking to fill up their gas tank will drive to the gas station and find an open stall. If there is not a stall open, they will wait until one becomes available. The car will pull up to the stall so that the car’s gas tank is easily accessible to the gas pump.
</p>

<p>
The patron will exit the car and inspect the gas pump. If the patron has determined to use their credit card to make payments, they will swipe their card through the card reader. If the credit card is a regular credit card, the reader will ask the patron to choose a fuel grade. If the credit card is a debit card, it will ask the patron whether to charge the card as debit or credit and then ask for the chosen fuel grade.  If the patron rather pay with cash, the will be asked to go inside and pay before pumping gas. They will pay the specific amount for gas and then walk back outside where the gas attendant has made the gas pump available to them. The patron will then press the appropriate fuel grade for their vehicle. The gas pump will then display the appropriate price per gallon to the patron. If the pump requires the patron to lift a lever for the handle, it will ask the patron to lift it before indicating it is ready for fueling, otherwise, it will indicate to the patron that they may begin fueling.
</p>

<p>
The patron will unscrew the gas cap to their vehicle and place the nozzle into the fuel tank. The patron will then squeeze the handle until gas is flowing at the desired speed. Some patrons will decide to “lock” the handle in place (if such a feature is available), therefore allowing them to freely move about the area while the gas pump fills the tank which will then “pop” once the tank is filled to the top, or in the case of those paying with cash, will stop when the monetary limit is reached. Other patrons will fill the gas tank themselves and watch the gas pump’s screen to monitor how much gas has been delivered to the machine, or they may monitor by how expensive the gas is. If the patron has determined not to wait until the gas tank is full, they will determine when to stop squeezing the handle to stop the flow of gas.
</p>

<p>
When satisfied with the amount of gas in the car’s tank, the patron will stop squeezing the handle, and remove the nozzle from the car and place it back at the gas pump’s cradle. They will then screw the gas cap back in place on their car. If they chose to receive a receipt from their purchase, they will gather it before stepping back into their car and driving away.
