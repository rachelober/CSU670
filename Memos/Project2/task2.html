<h1>Memo: Software Concepts and Use Cases for Purchasing Gas at a Self or Full Service Gas Station</h1>

<h2>Rachel Ober and Brandon Schory</h2>

<p>
The following describes the use cases for a software system used to process gas transactions. It should be noted that in a full service gas station, a station attendant, instead of the customer himself, would perform the first two use cases. Otherwise, all concepts stay the same. The system relies on stored values for types of gas offered and their associated prices, which are entered in to the system by the gas station owner. The only other internal piece of data necessary is a transaction record, which records the type and price of the gas, the total number of gallons purchased, the final cost of the gas for the transaction, and whether payment was received. The transaction record is dependent on the input of the customer and/or gas station attendant as described in the following use cases:
</p>

<p>
Customer Pays for Gas with Cash:
<ol>
	<li>Cashier collects cash and enters that payment is received</li>
	<li>Pump activates, and is limited to pumping the dollar amount of gas</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Customer Pays for Gas with a Credit Card:
<ol>
	<li>Check that credit card is valid, and bill it</li>
	<ol>
		<li>If not valid, cashier addresses situation and enters payment is valid</li>
	</ol>
	<li> Pump activates to allow customer to get gas</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Customer wants to fill their tank with gas:
<ol>
	<li>Once valid form of payment is received, lifting handle from pump creates new transaction</li>
	<li>Customer selects type of gas desired, which pulls record on pricing and sets those values</li>
	<li>Customer sets latch on handle to hold open flow of gas</li>
	<li>When pump senses tank if full, flow of gas is stopped, total is computed and billed for transaction</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Customer wants to fill their tank to a certain volume or dollar amount of gas (or pays with cash):
<ol>
	<li>Once valid form of payment is received, lifting handle from pump creates new transaction</li>
	<li>Customer selects type of gas desired, which pulls record on pricing and sets those values</li>
	<li>Customer holds handle to keep flow of gas open</li>
	<li>Customer lets go of handle (or flow of gas is stopped) when sensor readout shows the correct volume or dollar amount of gas</li>
	<li>Compute and bill total charge for transaction</li>
</ol>
