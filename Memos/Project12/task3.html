<h2>Project 12: Task 3</h2>
<h3>Revised XML Plans</h3>
<p>xtrn will need to be modified to include some kind of information about
fighters that can have cards swapped out. Because we already know about the bomber
squadrons, all we need is information about the fighters.</p>
<pre>
xtrn = &lt;TURN name=String&gt;
        stck   %% the deck 
        stck   %% the stack 
        slst   %% ALLIES bombers, attackable by AXIS fighters
        slst   %% AXIS bombers, attackable by ALLIES fighters
        slst   %% fighters, able to have cards swapped from
        &lt;/TURN&gt;
</pre>
<p>done will also need to be changed to allow for a list of swaps to be sent via XML. Within the new swap XML, we will need to pass information on the Squadron that will be replaced and the card that was taken from the Squadron.</p>
<pre>
done = &lt;END&gt; borc slst atck ... swap ... &lt;/END&gt;
     | &lt;RET&gt; card slst atck ... swap ... &lt;/RET&gt;
swap = &lt;SWAP&gt; squd card &lt;/SWAP&gt;
</pre>
