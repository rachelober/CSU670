<h1>Rachel Ober and Kaitlyn Hanrahan</h1>
<h2>Project 12: Task 1</h2>
<h3>Ideas for Changes</h3>
<p>Through brainstorming, we have decided that the best way to deal
with swapping cards is to change some of the interfaces for the game as well as to add a new class called "Swap." This Swap class will be formed from the newly changed Squadron and the resulting WildCard that the Player will now receive. This way, we can change other parts of our program to handle the Swap class rather than new variables that get floated around. This should make it easy when we need to check to make sure the swap was valid and pass that information along from the Player to the Administrator in XML.</p>
<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>
<p>The sequence diagram shouldn't change from what we see in Project 10. What will be important to note is that
the Administrator will be passing an extra parameter to Turn that has the Squadrons that are able to swap out WildCards. The Player will also be sending back a modified Done.</p>

I/O 1: TESTER reads an _xtrn_ and a _hand_ with all the necessary items
       for the Administrator from standard input. 
I/O 2: ProxyPlayer reads as many _mesg_ from standard input as there are
       and then one _done_. 
       The _mesg_s are turned into appropriate method calls. After
       it reads _done_, the ProxyPlayer finishes its turn and returns the
       specified information to play-one-turn. 
I/O 3: TESTER writes one of the following to standard output and then
       closes the port: 
       -- a CONTRACT _resp_, if a contract is violated;
       -- a TIMING _resp_, if a timing contract is violated;
       -- a CHEATING _resp_, if a rule of the game is violated;
       -- or the following five XML elements if the turn worked out okay: 
         bool  %% is this the end of the battle?
         borc  %% the return card (or false)
         slst  %% the discards 
         from  %% did the player take the cards from the stack or the deck?
         atta  %% (possibly empty) series of attacks

<h3>Proposed Interface Changes</h3>
<h4>Squadron</h4>
<pre>
# squadron_swap : Squadron Card -&gt; Card
#
# Swaps an Aircraft Card with a WildCard. If nothing can
# be swapped, returns nil. Needs to check that the Card
# being consumed is an Aricraft Card and the resulting Card
# is a WildCard.
</pre>
<h4>Turn</h4>
<pre>
# new : Deck Stack ListOf-Squadron ListOf-Squadron -&gt; Turn
# 
# Creates a new instance of a turn with the appropriate member data.
# First ListOf-Squadron are squadrons that are attackable by the Player.
# The second Squadron list are Squadrons that can have Cards swapped.
</pre>
<h4>Done</h4>
<pre>
# new : ListOf-Squadron ListOf-Squadon Borc ListOf-Swaps -&gt; Done
#
# Creates new Object of type Done. Needs contract to check that 
# ListOf-Swaps are valid Swaps (i.e. Squadron is valid Squadon and return
# Card is a WildCard.)
</pre>
<h4>Player (Strategy)</h4>
<pre>
# swap_cards : Player Card -&gt; Card
#
# Looks through the list_of_squadrons available to the
# Player and determines if they can swap a Card out
# to get a WildCard. This will be a Strategy method. Players can
# choose whether or not they want to participate in swapping.
# Needs contract to check that the given Card is an Aircraft
# and the resulting Card is a WildCard.
</pre>
<h4>Administrator</h4>
<pre>
# valid_swap? : Player Turn Done -&gt; Boolean
#
# Determines if the swap was valid. (i.e. Squadron is
# valid and contains the expected cards and the return Card is
# of the correct type.
</pre>
<h4>Swap</h4>
<pre>
# new : Squadron WildCard -&gt; Swap
#
# Creates a new Object of type Swap. Takes the Squadron
# that was manipulated and had an Aircraft Card swapped
# with a WildCard. Returns the WildCard that was swapped out.
# Contract to make sure that the Squadron is valid and that the
# WildCard is a valid WildCard.</pre>
